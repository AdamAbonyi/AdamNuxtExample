      "I started enjoying CCR diving in 2011 together with my dive/life companion, and we decided in the beginning of 2016 to change to the CCR Liberty. We found it more comfortable in terms of dimensions (the counterlungs are thinner, the handsets are smaller), more reliable, easier to prepare, and with a fantastic after sale service. We succeeded in the IANTD Hypoxic CCR Trimix Course and we dive as often as we can, enjoying together the pleasure of diving with this wonderful and reliable machine."

      "I started diving rebreathers around 2006 and pretty much stayed with the same unit. Although there were a number of other units on the market, nothing motivated me to move away from what I was using - until I saw the Liberty. A CCR manufactured with precision and quality in mind. A CCR that was compact and user friendly but at the same time offered me all the redundancy I needed to explore the depths and feel safe, every time."

      "The Liberty is different from other rebreathers. Technology is far above the market average. The build quality is very good: most parts are machined especially for the Liberty. It makes the Liberty independent from third party suppliers (especially for the electronics).The support and service from Divesoft are exceptional. I dive CCR’s more than 25 years and I am an Instructor Trainer for many rebreathers, I certified over 1250 CCR divers, now the Liberty is my primary and preferred CCR."
